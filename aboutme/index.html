        <p>Welcome to my Home Course Page, I'm Hassan Daniel Fiyinfoluwa from Lagos, Nigeria. 
            I live in a large city where education isn't easy to gain despite the large population.

            I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 6 years. The 
            things I love about the church is the worthiness and faith in Jesus Christ.

            Fortunately, I'm enrolled as an online student in BYU Idaho. Currently studying 
            Computer programming. This is my first Website and will be so happy to complete this.
